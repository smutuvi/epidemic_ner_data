More often than not, what Christians think of as “patriotism” is what God defines as being “idolatry.” Jesus once said “render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s” (Matthew 22:21), a radical statement publicly declaring that Caesar and Rome weren’t God, and were so disconnected that they required two separate offerings. While many contemporary Christians us

Nowadays fat has a bad rap. We hate it. We fear it. We name it. We blame it. We shame it. Some people will do whatever they can to destroy it and eliminate its "wrath" from their lives.

WASHINGTON ― After what seems like a never-ending stream of deadly mass shootings, many gun reform proponents fear that Americans have become too desensitized to bloodshed to demand action to end gun violence.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - By imposing new sanctions on Russia and condemning a suspected Russian chemical attack in Britain, Washington has hinted at a tougher stance toward Moscow despite President Donald Trump’s stated desire for better ties.

Evidently, President Trump just wants to hear positive news about himself. Recent news reports indicate that Trump is given two packets of positive, flattering news stories per day.

The show is being shared with over 22 millio

Dementia, Alzheimer s, senility, forgetfulness. All of these words point to an experience. But do they point to the same one? Are they different? Are they the same? I often hear these words thrown around interchangeably. Here I hope to give some etymological clarity. Aging in America is confusing. By using clear language, I hope we can communicate more effectively about our experiences. Through sh
You can choose your friends, but you can’t choose your family, or so says the adage.

The rate of teen births in the U.S. has been falling nearly continuously for two decades.

And that was an extraordinarily good year for the labor market. We wou

A modern proverb tells us traditional movie stars no longer exist, meaning glitzy luminaries who drive box-office business and stoke intrigue on name (and beauty) alone.

There are certain things about myself that I’ve had to come to grips with when it comes to sex, dating and relationships. I’m not a “cool girl;” while I can get down with some casual coitus, I tend to lean pretty heavily toward monogamy; and I can absolutely be a complete and utter fuckboy at times. But the biggest part of myself that I’ve come to accept — nay, embrace — is that I truly am a night

The White House chief of staff needs a history lesson. Yesterday, on Fox News, John Kelly claimed that a “lack of ability to compromise” led to the American Civil War.

The Republican lawmakers have sold the corporate portion of their tax cuts with the claim that it is actually about helping workers.

What is worse? Depression? Or psychosis? That was a question posed to me by a friend some years ago.

Busy is the new rich. We have come to equate being busy, overwhelmed and living in chaos with the notion that, "I am important. I matter!"

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Your money or your life? Sovaldi, a new pill for hepatitis C, cures the liver-wasting disease in nine of 10 patients, but treatment can cost more than $90,000.

The tragic loss of four American fighters in Niger reminds one that the U.S. has learned little from the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.

I broke up with alcohol in 2007, at the end of May. When people asked why I quit drinking, I just say that we had a bad relationship—and I was tired of being slapped around. I never want to go through withdrawal again. Detoxing was horrible. I shivered, vomited, and half-slept for days, sweating, hallucinating. I was too sick to call in to work. When my boss finally got a hold of me, she asked, “A
This week’s Republican National Convention has resembled nothing so much as a circus sideshow.

As wacky as the RNC seems, it’s only the latest exampl
"24 years. 364 days. Today. Just for today." That was one of my first thoughts upon awakening this morning. You see, I am an alcoholic. Fortunately, I m the kind of alcoholic who no longer drinks.
