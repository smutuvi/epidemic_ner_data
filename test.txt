formally O 
introduced O 
by O 
the O 
Health O 
Ministry O 
in O

specifically O 
advised O 
against O 
their O 
use O 
. O 

If O 
any O 
child O 
has O 
fever O 
, O 
the O 
first O 
assumption O 
should O 
be O 
that O 
it O 
is O 
dengue B-DIS

as O 
this O 
viral O 
disease O 
is O 
now O 
hyper O 
endemic O 
in O 
Sri B-LOC

, O 
he O

. O 

A O 
few O 
years O

if O 
we O 
saw O 
10 O 
children O 
with O 
fever O 
, O 
about O 
2 O 
3 O 
would O 
be O 
dengue B-DIS 
patients O 
. O 

But O 
now O 
in O 
Colombo O 
, O 
of O 
10 O 
children O 
with O 
fever O 
, O 
we O 
should O 
suspect O 
that O 
five O 
have O 
dengue B-DIS 
, O

in O 
Negombo O 
it O 
would O 
be O

in O 
Thailand O

also O 
helped O 
implement O 
such O 
measures O 
in O 
Pakistan O

, O 
he O 
said O 
that O 
when O 
called O 
upon O 
to O 
advise O 
paediatricians O 
all O 
over O 
the O 
country O 
on O 
managing O 
very O 
ill O 
children O 
he O 
had O 
come O 
across O 
many O 
who O 
had O 
bled O 
due O 
to O 
being O 
given O 
either O 
ibuprofen O

mefenamic O 
acid O 
before O 
admission O

“ O 
When O

, O 
don’t O 
give O 
NSAIDs O

down O

even O 
though O

could O 
be O

symptom O

parents O 
may O 
look O 
for O 
quick O

For O 
, O 
NSAIDs O 
would O 
then O 
do O 
more O 
harm O 
than O 
good O 
. O

that O 
dengue B-DIS

massive O

the O
